Any attempted \\n  assignment in violation of this section shall be void. \\n  \\xa0 \\n  Section 14.9 Force Majeure. Any delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party (except the payment of money \\n  owed) will not be considered a breach of this Agreement if such delay is caused by a labor dispute, shortage of materials, fire, earthquake, flood, or \\n  any other event beyond the control of such party, provided that such party uses reasonable efforts, under the circumstances, to notify the other \\n  party of the circumstances causing the delay and to resume performance as soon as possible. \\n  \\xa0 \\n  Section 14.10 Third Party Beneficiary.
